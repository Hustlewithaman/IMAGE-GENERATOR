🚀 Just Built a Mini Project: Random Dog Image Generator 🐶
Tech Used: HTML | CSS | JavaScript | API Fetch | JSON

I recently created a fun and simple mini project that dynamically generates random dog images using the Dog CEO API. This project was a great way to strengthen my skills in frontend development, especially working with API fetching, JSON data handling, and DOM manipulation.

🔧 How it Works:
When a user clicks the “Get Dog Image” button, the app fetches a random dog image from the Dog CEO API (https://lnkd.in/gSdGbkGH) using JavaScript’s fetch() method. The returned JSON data contains a URL to the image, which is then displayed inside a styled image container using CSS.

🎯 Key Concepts Practiced:

API Fetching & working with JSON data

Event-driven programming (addEventListener)

Real-time DOM updates

Styling with responsive CSS

Clean code structure and error handling

💡 This was a fun way to explore how web apps interact with external APIs and present data dynamically to users. It's simple but shows how even basic tools like HTML, CSS, and JS can come together to make something interactive and visually engaging.
